    * Unit Manual:
      * Light unit used to constuct buildings, gather resources, and perform repairs. 
      * Can only attack ground targets.
      * Can be used to support your mechanical units in battle.
      * Not typically used for combat, but can be used to survive a rush when backed up with a few Marines.
      * SCVs are the most resilent worker unit, compared to other two Races.
      * Can repair themselves.
      * Lots of SCVs can collect minerals at a faster rate.
      * No more than three of them to a single Refinery.
      * If Enemy SCVs are found near your base, attack the SCVs instead of the structure.
      * Use workers to scout; they're cheap and fast.
